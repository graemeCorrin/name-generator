# Name Generator

This project is inspired by the procedurally generated deck names in the Unique Deck Game [KeyForge](https://www.keyforgegame.com/).

It uses a [context-free grammar (CFG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar) to define the rules that make up a valid name, then evaluates that grammar, making a weighted random choice at each decision point.

## The Grammar
Context-free grammars are described by a four-element tuple, G = (V, Σ, R, S), where
 - V is a finite set of variables (non-terminal)
-  Σ is a finite set terminal symbols
-  R is a set of production rules where each production rule maps a variable to a string s∈(V∪Σ)∗;
-  S a start symbol (which is in V)

### V (Variables)
||||
|--|--|--|
start|proper_noun|full_name
name_first_phrase|name_last_phrase|modifier
of_who_from|of_modifier|who_modifier
from_modifier|noun_thing_phrase|noun_place_phrase
adjective_phrase|adverb_verb_phrase|verb_phrase
verb_transitive|verb_intransitive|

### Σ (Terminals)
||||
|--|--|--|
adjective|adverb|name_first
name_last|name_nickname|noun_place
noun_thing|preposition|pronoun
title_action|title_simple|title_standalone
verb_intransitive|verb_transitive|initial
name_fantasy|noun_place_fantasy|

Each terminal symbol resolves to a random string:
 - initial takes a random letter
 - name_fantasy and noun_place_fantasy use another CFG to create a made up name from a set of syllables
 - All remaining terminals take a random string from the relevant database table


### R (Production Rules)
 - start → proper_noun + , + modifier
 - start → pronoun + who_modifier

 - proper_noun → full_name
 - proper_noun → title_simple + full_name
 - proper_noun → title_standalone + full_name

 - full_name → name_first_phrase
 - full_name → name_last_phrase
 - full_name → name_nickname
 - full_name → name_first_phrase + name_nickname
 - full_name → name_first_phrase + name_last_phrase
 - full_name → name_first_phrase + name_nickname + name_last_phrase
 - full_name → name_nickname + name_last_phrase

 - name_first_phrase → initial
 - name_first_phrase → name_first
 - name_first_phrase → name_fantasy
 
 - name_last_phrase → of_who_from
 - name_last_phrase → name_last
 - name_last_phrase → name_fantasy

 - modifier → initial
 - modifier → the + title_standalone
 - modifier → the + title_standalone + of_who_from
 - modifier → title_action + of + noun_thing_phrase

 - of_who_from → of_modifier
 - of_who_from → who_modifier
 - of_who_from → from_modifier

 - of_modifier → of + noun_place_phrase
 - of_modifier → of + noun_thing_phrase

 - who_modifier → who + adverb_verb_phrase
 
 - from_modifier → from+ noun_place_phrase
 
 - noun_thing_phrase → noun_thing
 - noun_thing_phrase → adjective_phrase + noun_thing
 
 - noun_place_phrase → noun_place
 - noun_place_phrase → noun_place_fantasy
 
 - adjective_phrase → adjective
 - adjective_phrase → adverb + adjective_phrase 
  
 - adverb_verb_phrase → verb_phrase
 - adverb_verb_phrase → adverb + verb_phrase
  
 - verb_phrase → verb_transitive_phrase
 - verb_phrase → verb_intransitive_phrase
  
 - verb_transitive_phrase → verb_transitive
 - verb_transitive_phrase → verb_transitive + noun_thing_phrase
  
 - verb_intransitive_phrase→ verb_intransitive
 - verb_intransitive_phrase→ verb_intransitive + preposition + noun_thing_phrase
 

### S (Start)
 - start

## Random Seed
Before generating a name, the random module is seeded.  If a seed is passed in from the client, it will be used to seed the random module.  Therefore, every time you use that seed, you will get the same name (unless code or data has changes, of course).

You can use your own name as a seed, and find out *your* crazy name.

## Setup

### Requirements
* Python 3.7
* PostgreSQL 12.3

Any very of PostgreSQL should work.  Tested with 9.6 and 12.3.

It will not run on Python 2, and some of the packages break with Python 3.8; they need to be updated before it will run on 3.8.  For now, everything works on 3.7.

**Install required modules into your virtual environment**
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Create new database**
```
psql
create database name_generator_dev
```

**Initialize database schema**
```
manage.py db upgrade
```


**Populate database**
Run all sql scripts in data folder

## Running the app server

Run
```
manage.py runserver
```

## Adding Migrations
Modify the models
Then, to create a new migration script, run
```
manage.py db migrate
```

Then, to run the new migration script, run
```
manage.py db upgrade
```



## ToDo

 - [x] Build basic server functionality
 - [x] Add random seed option to UI
 - [x] Create Context Free Grammar to build possible name structures
 - [x] Pull name components from database
 - [x] Populate all read-only database tables
 - [x] Add fantasy name generating logic
 - [x] Add location name generating logic
 - [ ] Populate name and location syllable tables
 - [ ] Add redis task queue
 - [ ] Add more options to front-end
 
 
## Known Issues
 - Places need to be split into proper names and normal names.  Proper names should not have adjectives, normal names require an article, but adjectives go between article and noun.
 - Commas should be placed between 2 or more adverbs
 - Should be possible to get multiple adjectives
